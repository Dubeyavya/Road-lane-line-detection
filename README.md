# Road Lane Line Detection Project

## Objective
The primary goal of the Road Lane Line Detection project in data science is to develop a robust computer vision system capable of accurately identifying and localizing lane lines on the road. This project is motivated by the increasing demand for intelligent systems in the automotive industry, including applications such as autonomous vehicles, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and road safety analysis.

## Key Features
- **Lane Line Detection**: Utilizes advanced computer vision techniques, including Canny edge detection and Hough transform algorithms, to identify and extract lane lines from input images or video streams.

- **Dynamic Region of Interest (ROI)**: Adapts the region of interest dynamically to different road scenarios, ensuring the system remains versatile across various environments and conditions.

- **Visualization**: Generates visually compelling outputs by overlaying highlighted lane lines onto the original images or video frames, aiding in a clear understanding of the detection results.

## Why Lane Detection?
Accurate lane line detection is a critical component in the development of autonomous vehicles and ADAS. By precisely identifying and understanding lane boundaries, vehicles can make informed decisions, navigate safely, and contribute to overall road safety.

## Dependencies
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV**: A popular computer vision library.
- **NumPy**: Essential for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization.
- **MoviePy**: Required for video processing.
